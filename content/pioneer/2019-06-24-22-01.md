week two. submitted my update and review others'. it was a fun process and my feedback mainly fell into three categories

voting was a good exercise purely for the reflexive aspect: by judging others' projects, it helped to see how mine compared and where it could improve. ballpark itself is going well, but i'll improve the way i communicate this in the updates. bullets not sentences.
