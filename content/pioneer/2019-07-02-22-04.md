results from the voting came in and it was good: I moved up from \~100th to \~30th globally, so definite improvement. still around the same gap to 1st place though. not sure where you have to place to be awarded the prize, but all i can do is keep making progress and going forwards.

it's good for accountability, and those leaderboards really do work. it's also promising as ballpark uses a similar mechanic. 

something i've tried to do is reach out more to other pioneers, especially those in my village, but there doesn't seem to be that willingness, which is understandable. i feel like i'm taking it a little more serious than most...

practising my pitch every now and then as have a meeting in a couple of days that could turn out to be an investment opportunity. i feel confident about the vision of ballpark and where it's going, and i'm not desperate (at the moment), which works in my favour.
