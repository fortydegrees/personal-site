did the voting, and seems like several others have made very good progress. it's motivating to see.

on the other side, it does seem hard to fairly judge from an ambiguous metric such as 'progress'. some projects have pitched multiple VCs and given talks at conferences, but then have ten people working on them and have been launched for years. it's hard to compare to pre-launch projects with a single person working on it.

worked on the automatic emailing system for ballpark, including the styling of the email template. when in circles for a few hours but drilled through and got a finished result, which i'm happy with. sent a deck out to a few investors and we'll see what happens.
