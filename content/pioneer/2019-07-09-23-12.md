missed out on the $1,000 prize, which went to those in the top 10. my update was warmly received, but wasn't exceptional. didn't get much constructive feedback in terms of what to improve on. not too sure how i can improve it that much. i haven't lost much ground from the top 10 since the first week with the poor initial report. wondering if this will continue to affect the ranking. probably not.

i've got to most flat this week which makes things difficult, but i still want to put myself in contention. i think i need to stop focusing on polish and ship an app with users. for ballpark i can drill this down to core features:

* list current running pre-game events.
* win ballpark points for these
* some games have cash prizes
* leaderboards
* profile history page

got an investor event on friday. if i can somehow get an app ready for then it could also progress fundraising talks.

not sure what a dream update could look like as i do think i'm constrained by being one person working on a pre-launch app.

let's just play the hand well.
