woke up rested, did jiu jitsu and went to the office. felt very positive and motivated.

asked in the village discord about productivity systems and how to track progress. got a range of responses from picking a metric to 'just do it'. the latter being the approach i usually adopt.

a couple villagers spoke highly of the simple idea of breaking down a larger task into its component parts, and ticking them off. someone mentioned the tracking software toggl to monitor hours, which i'll start using tomorrow and see how i get on.

project specifics:

* implemented a functioning dashboard with a GUI for adding games
* created API functions to handle the game creation requests, and to serve games to the front end

tomorrow i want to style the front end that i'm coding in nextJS, and ideally port all of the static site over. [every layout](https://every-layout.dev/) just entered the zeitgeist and skimmed that. feels like i've already ingratiated most of the concepts, but should serve as a good guide to allow for a solid design system that'll be easy to expand on.
