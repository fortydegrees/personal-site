used the pomodoro technique today. 25 mins in, 5 mins break - strictly no distractions for that time. it worked very well. did 14 'pomodoros' for just under six hours of constant work.

what i specifically like about it is that it translates work into a grammar i understand: sets and reps. it's an easy target to increase the amount of 'sets' (25 min blocks) per day, which is something i'll track. 

many times i got to the end of 25 mins and was prompted to take a break, but didn't want to. i feel for writing and reading, this may be fine, but did feel like it dragged me out of a state of deep work, and that i could have continued. i'm interested in experimenting with the format: longer reps (e.g. 40 minutes) but for now would rather not complicate things.

ballpark is still at a stage where i'm coding everything up. got stuck wrapping my head around react-spring and cohesively integrating that animation package - it's important i do it right as UX is a fundamental component of the project. whenever i get stuck i'm tempted to _fuck it, drive on_, and put out a viable product, but remind myself that i've already got the validation, and now we're playing for keeps.

considering it's just coding, the only thing i'm optimizing for right now is distraction-free work. pomodoro seems good for now.

tomorrow's goals:

* 15+ sets of 25mins
