felt good - certainly feel very fit. did three hours before jiu jitsu and then eight afterwards and then called it quits. used toggle but don't really understand the use. for me its functionality was just reduced to a stopwatch. i don't think i'll continue.

it's an interesting problem to conceptualise: for fitness goals, you can really track your progress clearly - whether distance ran or weight lifted - and start to drill down on the factors related to it: mindset, sleep, diet, training pattern. so far i can't see a way of doing the same for mental work.

my weakness right now is in focus: while i feel like it's okay, i think i can make strong gains here. i found myself willingly distracted by whatsapp, emails, and other chat applications. almost by definition it's hard to track, but have heard about the pomodoro technique being quite constructive, and maybe i can use 'complete' pomodoros as a productivity metric: complete in that i wasn't distracted by my phone or other low-hanging-fruit.
