sleep was poor due to personal reasons. used it as an opportunity to be more conscious of my mental processes when i knew i wasn't fully rested. found it hard to drill into a task, and after an hour or so of trying resigned myself to less cognitively-intense tasks, such as market research and user interviews.

didn't have the 'drive' to start a pomodoro, which i guess is both good and bad. i like it because it's an identifiable sticking point, and it also means i'm 'respecting' the protocol.
