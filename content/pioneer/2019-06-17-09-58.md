playing to win the [pioneer tournament](pioneer.app) starting today. this will be a log of my progress and to help me actively reflect on the strategy i'm using to play.

my project for the tournament is [ballpark](playballpark.com) - an app that allows users to win real prizes by making free predictions on their favourite events.

the tournament at a glance:

* outline and define a project you want to work on
* develop your project and help others develop theirs
* you log your weekly contributions and others vote on the value of these
* these factors form a points score and you're ranked in a leaderboard
* place at the top of the leaderboard and win $7,000, a round-trip to silicon valley, and access to world-class mentorship.

my goals:

* develop a greater understanding of what behvaiours contribute to my productivity
* form valuable mutually beneficial relationships with impressive people
* develop a writing habit / increase my accountability
* win the money & the plane ticket

my initial playing strategy:

* sleep well - no alarms
* be helpful - offer feedback for other players in your village
* physical exercise every day - mainly bjj and weightlifting
* eat well
* nine hours of ass-in-chair work, six days a week
