writing the strategy document. it’s fun, but i haven’t written in a while. it’s hard, and while i usually relish something difficult, i’ve been finding it hard to motivate myself for it. 

i find coding a lot easier, as you’re presented with novel problems and you know when you’ve solved them. the feedback and progress is obvious. with writing it’s hard to know if you’re making progress, as for me at least, i’m constantly judging what i’ve written against a very vague criteria.

it’s easy to question whether i’m doing the most productive thing i can, and even what that should be, but it’ll be nice to have something to point to that justifies what i’m working on, beyond coding an app for people to use.
