good sleep, good eating, good working.

i'm at a state now where i have an effective system: i know how much i need to sleep and how to do it, and i have a structured productivity scheme that i can measure my performance against. execution of this protocol is the easy part.

i'm still feeling confident  about the ballpark project. feedback is consistently good - what questionmarks there are at the moment all lie with me and in things i can control, which is a state of affairs i'm comfortable with.

for next week, i plan to make these updates more specific regarding the technical work i'm doing. i feel like the scope of the first week was to find productivity habits, and now i want to increase the granularity of these entries. i think this'll help me clarify my vision and integrate smaller parts into a wider vision. excited for this switch-up.
