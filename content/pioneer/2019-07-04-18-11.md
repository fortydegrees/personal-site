reached out to a member of my pioneer board. they have a history of marketing consumer startups, and my question concerned strategic positioning for ballpark, in terms of how it’s branded/communicated to users.

the default is big and broad: it’s an app to make predictions on live events, whether that’s formula 1 or love island. doesn’t matter, same app.

another option is to focus on a niche community and conquer that. say, formula 1. just run it for them, make them love it, and then expand. this follows the popular advice of ‘get 100 users who love you then expand’, and monopolising a smaller demographic and expanding.

the community to target could be varied - underrepresented sports is another one, as this would also promote some social good, and there does also seem to be a rising demand for the consumption of minority sports, and this could benefit.

it just seems weird leaving a massive chunk off the table. would love some thoughts on this as the strategies seem mutually exclusive.
