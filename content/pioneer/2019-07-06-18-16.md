woke up early and managed to add a few defensive features to the site, mainly proper session management. spoke to several users to solicit product feedback and in general it aligns with what i'm working on: mainly leaderboards and some form of progression system. for now i feel like i'm quite in-synch with the user and what they want.

pitched someone the vision and that went well. they were very curious about the idea, how it could work form a monetary perspective, the challenges faced and why it hasn't been done before - all of which i can give very confident answers towards. they want to move the conversation forwards, which is a great sign.

i'm not too sure on issues like valuation and haven't even incorporated yet, but it's great getting external feedback and helps more the project forwards.

i'll submit my weekly update tomorrow - feel like it's been a good week even though i've missed some goals which were lofty. that said, i've expanded in areas i didn't fully expect, such as fundraising. next week i really want to focus a lot more on the project and building out proper features.
