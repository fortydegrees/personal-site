spent most of the day drafting a version of a pitch deck i want to show to investors.

haven’t thought too much about fundraising strategy at the moment and have been focusing on building. considering how much of a full time job fundraising can be, i’m apprehensive to start down that path before having the product in a presentable state.

there's always a trade-off though and it's a common, re-occuring problem: that in a vacuum, it's often hard to work out what the most effective job you can be doing right now. naturally i consider that to be building the product, as that's ultimately what grows the project and helps accomplishes the long term goal, but by working with others and raising capital, it obviously allows the productivity levels of the project to increase.

there could also be the case where i'm avoiding fundraising because it's _hard_, whereas sitting in a chair and coding all day is easier.
