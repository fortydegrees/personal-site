today started well. implemented the design for the post-game on boarding. spent a while playing with animation styles, which were tricky to integrate in the way i wanted to. eventually left these as there's a lot of other, more essential jobs to be done for the MVP launch on friday. it won't make or break the product.

think i need to pull back on the mid-day jiu jitsu, as I find it difficult to get back into work. it's a shame as i really enjoy it. it's something i'll look to improve.

generally pretty happy with my pioneer strategy. i'm putting in effort into the game, in terms of feedback and messaging other players. it's fun.
