first round scoring is in, and i took an absolute beating on the weekly updates. dropped from 1st to 95th. my ignorance of the voting format played a little part. i know what i need to do now. time to cover that ground.

so i'm going to reverse engineer the perfect weekly update, as these have a huge role in determining your score. quite simply it's 280 characters of the progress you made in the week, and 280 about what you want to do next week.

i said i wanted to have shipped the MVP: meaning admin dashboard and initial product.

this is what i want to put as my progress:

* launched MVP: front-end, back-end, emailing, stats
* 500+ signups
* pitch deck developed and sent

to accomplish next week:

* mobile app launch in app store
* have two investor meetings
* instagram & SEO strategy
* get a paid sponsor for a game
* prototype new features and games (achievements)
