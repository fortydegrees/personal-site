[ballpark](playballpark.com) is the project i'm working on for the tournament. it's currently a website where you can make free predictions about live events, and win real prizes. i tried it out for a few events, posting it to reddit, and got thousands of signups and very positive user interest.

managing games was rather arduous, and so with some form of market validation, i'm taking a step back and recoding the site in NextJS and developing a proper API. i will then create a mobile app for it.
