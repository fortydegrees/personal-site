did a tiny bit of styling work on the saturday, but in total it was about an hour's worth of work. sunday was a complete zero.

i'm considering these days as rest days, which irks me a tiny bit but i think falls comfortably in the category of work-life balance. it's something i struggle with as i have a tendency to feel guilty enjoying myself, but i'm in my 20s in a great city with great friends and it's summer. being able to spend time with them is not only valuable and something i can't see myself regretting, but probably beneficial for my productivity.

working alone isn't ideal, and so balancing this out with a social release creates greater gains in my emotional wellbeing which seep through into my work. i also think it's a good opportunity to re-frame and re-motivate for the coming week.
