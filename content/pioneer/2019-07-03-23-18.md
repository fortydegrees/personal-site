css styling. boring. tedious. not making much visible progress. i think i need to more precisely define what i want the launched mvp to look like. i already have my validation, but then considering pioneer, you can’t just keep providing updates like ‘coded more…’. i wouldn’t necessarily say that it promotes short-term thinking, but an element of it is pandering to the crowd.

i said in my update i wanted to lauch an app in the week, which was definitely ambitious, but i considered that i was only really competing against myself, and that it's okay to fail goals. i haven't made any technical progress towards this and i'm unlikely to achieve it. 1 week for an app port with other commitments does seem like a big ask. i don't think i should take too much of a punishment for it, but definitely want to debrief how i picked that goal and what i could have done differently on either side.

finding concentration a little harder to achieve. i kind of like it because when everything is going well, you don’t learn as much. i have to learn to focus when i don't want to, and believe i can make good gains in this area.
