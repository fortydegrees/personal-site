Think of a 2x2 matrix: easy, hard. simple, complex

the simple are strategies and behaviours that are easy to understand and implement: think one-dimensional.

complex strategies are multivariate - they have more going on and working out how to do them is difficult.

easy and hard describe the effort required to execute.

some examples:

easy, simple: browsing twitter, personal hygiene

easy, complex: buying a present, choosing cloothes

hard, simple: exercise, meditation

hard, complex: hiring, painting, job hunting, dating



easy simple are bad and we all know it - anyone can do them at any time and so there's little value

easy complex feel good, but are actually time sinks

hard complex are good but very difficult to execute - not everyone can do it

hard simple are things everyone can do. easy to work out how to do them, requires effort to execute on.



the way in which you approach a task can change its categorisation: a casual loading up pokerstars to bluff a few hands for 30 minutes is. the player who has hand tracking software and reads strategy and psychology books is seeing more.

I think one of the areas where we leave the most easily captured value on the table is in the simple hard category.

don't be geat. just be repeatedly good. (https://blog.stephsmith.io/how-to-be-great/) (mundanity of excellence)

everyone has effort, it can be fostered throguh multiple strategies. not everyone can work out the right strategy, and you often won't know if you have the right one.

the beauty comes in chunking the complex hard down into multiple simple hards, but i'll leave that as a meta-strategy for the reader.

what organisations do this chunking? // theory: all good organisations do this chunking well

the army
