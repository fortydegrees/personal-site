think of a 2x2 matrix: easy, hard : simple, complex

the simple are strategies and behaviours that are easy to understand and implement: think one-dimensional. complex strategies are multivariate - they have more going on and working out how to do them is difficult. easy and hard describe the effort required to execute.

some examples*:

* **simple, easy:** browsing twitter, watching TV, brushing your teeth
* **simple, hard:** running a marathon, healthy diet, meditating
* **complex, easy:** buying a present, going on holiday, choosing furniture
* **complex, hard:** hiring, painting, job hunting, dating

simple easy is low hanging fruit: everyone can do it, so in terms of improvement, there's little value to be gained. complex easy requires thinking and are more challenging mentally, but due to their low effort are also very doable. complex hard are those things we all know to be good and impressive and not many can do them. naturally very valuable, they require expertise and a high level of performance. 

but one of the areas where the most easily captured value is left on the table is in the simple hard category. it's simple to run a marathon, to become fluent in another language or learning an instrument: you just have to keep putting one foot in front of the other. what makes these challenging is the required effort.

but here's the rub: everyone has effort, it can be fostered through multiple strategies. not everyone can work out the right strategy, and you often won't know if you have the right one.

but now here's the real beauty: there is no difference between simple and complex. the complex is just a bunch of simples. the act of deconstructing the complex into its simple parts is difficult, but with the wealth of information we have available, this is only becoming easier.

this is what great companies are good at: they are machines that chunk the complex, difficult processes into simple, discrete ones. McDonald's consistently deliver popular food by having their staff follow easy, repeatable steps. A good army handles the chaos of battle with reliable, trained and tested tactics: cover and move, force multiply.

conclusion: the only thing stopping you is effort.

if you can do the simple things consistently, you can make great gains. don't be geat. just be repeatedly good. (https://blog.stephsmith.io/how-to-be-great/) (mundanity of excellence)

**additional thoughts:**

\* the way in which you approach and perceive a task can change its categorisation: an amateur playing internet poker to bluff a few hands for 30 minutes is simple easy. a player who has hand tracking software and studys the game is in the 'hard' territory.
