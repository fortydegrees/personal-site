### The Problem

* [Innovation outside of London is poor.](http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ResurgenceRegionsRALJv22_5_19.pdf)
* There are no great career paths to prepare the nation's smartest to be their most useful in the modern economy. As Peter Theil says: the smarter you are, the narrower your career: consultant, lawyer, doctor, banker.
* Diversity of experience is poor. The nation's smartest all come from similar backgrounds and think in the same way, and mimetic desire causes them to tackle the same problems over and over again.
* Many important but unsexy jobs fail to attract good talent - especially in the public sector.
* There is no great way for a nerd to effectively serve their country.


### Interlude: Special Forces

The SAS, Green Berets or Navy Seals are all high-performance teams. Not only are they highly effective as military units achieving mission goals, they also provide a lot of value for the individual:

* Access to other A-players

* Act of service to a cause greater than yourself

* Rapid learning and training in multiple domains

* Variablity and excitement 

* Challenge - knowing you're performing at your best

* Status

This is a beneficial relationship for all parties: the military gets elite units, and the soldier gets transcendent personal growth.

### The Solution

Imagine a competitive three year programme where accepted individuals are employed on a Â£24k salary by the government and are sent on six month work placements in a wide range of companies all over the country. Roles could range from being a social worker to growth marketing for a startup to a receptionist at an overstaffed GP surgery.

The people on the programme would be determined, have a large capacity for personal risk, flexible, curious, personable and intelligent. In other words, a good profile fit for a startup founder.

Their primary task would be work the job as prescribed. The work would not be glamorous which is why they should be resourceful enough to either endure through poor working environments (and take the learning), or make it a good environment. 

The point is that not only are they doing useful work, but they'd also be gaining exposure of those subtle, hidden industry problems that are such good sources for startup-based solutions. Their skillset should should allow them to identify pain points, have the skillset to ideate and develop a solution, and they would be in the perfect environment to get their first customer.

The programme needs to capture this upside as effectively as possible: individuals would be in close contact with a mentor and encouraged to talk about problems or frustrations they face. There would be the opportunity to apply for funding twice a year, with mentorship, office space, network access and other government resources provided. If funding is granted, they would work on the startup/product idea full time.

If they fail to create a viable startup/product, they can be reassigned to a new job after six months. This can repeat indefinitely, though they can be cut at any time.

The specifics aren't important and can be worked out through experimentation. What is important is that the scheme: has status, is difficult, pushes people, encourages rapid learning, and helps out others beyond the individual.

### Considerations

* It needs to be well branded. The work won't be glamorous. These people should want to work 60+ hour weeks and should be doing it not for the money but for the sense of service.

* I like the idea of making them engage and volunteer with local community causes too, solving the Bowling Alone problem. Is this relevant or asking too much? It would help develop skills and leadership.

* There should be a moderate dropout rate, especially early on.

* A balance needs to be struck where people aren't doing it for the money (low salary), but that it's not just available those who are more financially secure.

* Decision makers (programme acceptance, funding decisions) must have skin in the game as they are making bets on 10+ year timeframes and power law distributions and so must be incentivised appropriately. Focus should be on not missing, rather than hitting. (I've written about this problem previously with [the problems of corporate innovation])

* This is absolutely not the civil service fast stream, but it's what it should be. Are you instantly impressed if someone says they're a fast streamer? I will write more about this in at a later date.

If you were offered the best mix of education, experience and network in your 20s, but that you wouldn't earn a penny until you're 30, would you take it?

This is for those who would bite your hand off at that offer.
