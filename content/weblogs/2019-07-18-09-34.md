"To be selected into Valhalla was your reward for valor, bravery, courage and an unyielding devotion to your fellow man in combat. Valhalla was a place where the brave live forever. The myth of Valhalla has permeated modern special operations culture and is an outstanding analogy for those seeking to understand and tap into the mindset of warrior culture."
