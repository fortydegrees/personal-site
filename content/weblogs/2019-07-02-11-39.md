“I used to be embarrassed because i was just a comic-book writer while other people were building bridges or going on to medical careers.

And then i began to realize: entertainment is one of the most important things in people's lives. Without it, they might go off the deep end. I feel that if you're able to entertain, you're doing a good thing.”

\-Stan Lee
