this site is currently a repository for my [public diary](pioneer) while doing a Pioneer tournament.

i like training diaries. they keep you accountable and are great for ingraining a habit of structured reflection. what started as sharing thoughts, methods and progress over email with some of the best training partners i've had has morphed into a blog. yknow, for visibility.

always open to new ideas. keep the load heavy but your life light.
